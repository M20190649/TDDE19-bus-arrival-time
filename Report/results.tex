\chapter{Results}
\label{cha:results}
This section present results in the form of performance metrics for the investigate models. Both the NN model and the GP model performed well.

% This chapter presents the results. Note that the results are presented
% factually, striving for objectivity as far as possible.  The results
% shall not be analyzed, discussed or evaluated.  This is left for the
% discussion chapter.

% In case the method chapter has been divided into subheadings such as
% pre-study, implementation and evaluation, the result chapter should
% have the same sub-headings. This gives a clear structure and makes the
% chapter easier to write.

% In case results are presented from a process (e.g. an implementation
% process), the main decisions made during the process must be clearly
% presented and justified. Normally, alternative attempts, etc, have
% already been described in the theory chapter, making it possible to
% refer to it as part of the justification.
