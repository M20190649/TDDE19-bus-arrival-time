\chapter{Theory}
\label{cha:theory}
This chapter aims to explain concepts and methods that are used is our implementations.

\section{Gaussion Processes}
A Gaussian Process (\textit{GP}) is, in statistical terms, a stochastic process such that any set of the variables have a multivariate normal distribution. Such a distribution is defined by a mean vector $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\sigma$, where every random variable spans one dimension. Viewed through the lens of machine learning, the GP serves as a non-parametric regression model.

\subsection{Gaussian Process Regression}
GP regression (also known as kriging) is a non-parametric generative model that builds on the assumption that all data points are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. A GP $f$ is consequently defined as $f \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$. Zero mean can be assumed without loss of generality and is done for mathematical convenience, but in practice $\mu$ could be any suitable mean vector. The covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is thus the only free parameter to be chosen. Unfortunately, a covariance matrix over a continuous function would exist only in an infinite dimensional space, which is indeed problematic. However, the spaces we are interested in have an inner product corresponding to some covariance function $c(x, x') = cov(f(x), f(x'))$ for the process $f$ and data points $x$, $x'$, and this function can be kernelised as $k(\theta, x, x') = cov(f(x), f(x'))$ for some valid kernel function $k$ and its hyperparameters $\theta$. It is consequently possible to compute $\Sigma$ given a set of data points and a kernel function, circumventing the need to construct infinite dimensional spaces.

Thanks to the kernel trick the choice of parameters is consequently not a covariance matrix $\Sigma$ but a kernel $k(\theta, x, x')$ and its hyperparameters $\theta$. This choice represent our prior over $f$, and in particular it represents how smooth we believe $f$ is by imposing certain covariance on $f(x)$ for nearby points. This is the key idea of a GP regression and what makes it very flexible: It allows us to specify a prior over $f$ as a function of $x$, without even knowing $f$.

% The main purpose of this chapter is to make it obvious for
% the reader that the report authors have made an effort to read
% up on related research and other information of relevance for
% the research questions. It is a question of trust. Can I as a
% reader rely on what the authors are saying? If it is obvious
% that the authors know the topic area well and clearly present
% their lessons learned, it raises the perceived quality of the
% entire report.

% After having read the theory chapter it shall be obvious for
% the reader that the research questions are both well
% formulated and relevant.

% The chapter must contain theory of use for the intended
% study, both in terms of technique and method. If a final thesis
% project is about the development of a new search engine for
% a certain application domain, the theory must bring up related
% work on search algorithms and related techniques, but also
% methods for evaluating search engines, including
% performance measures such as precision, accuracy and
% recall.

% The chapter shall be structured thematically, not per author.
% A good approach to making a review of scientific literature
% is to use \emph{Google Scholar} (which also has the useful function
% \emph{Cite}). By iterating between searching for articles and reading
% abstracts to find new terms to guide further searches, it is
% fairly straight forward to locate good and relevant
% information, such as \cite{test}.

% Having found a relevant article one can use the function for
% viewing other articles that have cited this particular article,
% and also go through the article’s own reference list. Among
% these articles on can often find other interesting articles and
% thus proceed further.

% It can also be a good idea to consider which sources seem
% most relevant for the problem area at hand. Are there any
% special conference or journal that often occurs one can search
% in more detail in lists of published articles from these venues
% in particular. One can also search for the web sites of
% important authors and investigate what they have published
% in general.

% This chapter is called either \emph{Theory, Related Work}, or
% \emph{Related Research}. Check with your supervisor.
