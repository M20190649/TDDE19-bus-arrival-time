This chapter contains the following sub-headings.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:discussion-results}


\section{Method}
\label{sec:discussion-method}

\subsection{Gaussian Process regression}
The Gaussian Process regression approach did not use the full training set since it was computationally expensive to compare data with each trajectory. Using fewer comparison trajectories means that the model does considers fewer kinds of behaviours and may therefore have worse predictions with a model considering all comparison trajectories, however it will be faster.

The synchronisation was challenging to get to work well. The mapping between spatial coordinates and progress was done with a synchronisation GP trained on a hand picked trajectory that seemed to represent the whole dataset fairly well, however changing that trajectory, made a big difference on how good the GP mapped coordinates into progress. Some effort was put into trying out different trajectories to train the synchronisation GP, but finding a better one could improve the synchronisation process.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future-work}
Having the time schedule of the buses available would allow for some interesting new approaches. At any given station the current delay could be fed into the neural network. Since bus driver drive faster and dwell less when they are late, having this as an input could improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore a very simple baseline model could be created using the time schedule. By simple using the offset of the last bus it should be possible to make acceptable predictions, as two subsequent bus often have similar delays due to traffic conditions.

The recurrent neural network model (ANN model 4) could possibly perform better if a longer sequence of data points were used. Due to hardware constraints the model in this work uses sequences of 20 data points as input, more than that required additional RAM. Doing this would either require more capable hardware or some exploration of how to split the training up into multiple sessions where the data is divided into smaller chunks.
