\subsection{Evaluation Methods}
There a two main differences in the methods that we have used. The baseline method and the M1 model do predictions on complete segments. Those two methods do not have the capability of making sophisticated predictions within a segment, therefore measurements inter-segment predictions are done by subtracting the time spent on the segment from the time predicted for the whole segment. This leads to an increased MAPE as the prediction error remains constant but with using less and less distance to predict on (80,60,40,20), the constant error corresponds to larger parts of the sub-segment.
