\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

We have shown that we could make good predictions on bus arrival times. blabla

\subsection{Future Work}
Having the time schedule of the buses available would allow for some interesting new approaches. At any given station the current delay could be fed into the neural network. Since bus driver drive faster and dwell less when they are late, having this as an input could improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore a very simple baseline model could be created using the time schedule. By simple using the offset of the last bus it should be possible to make acceptable predictions, as two subsequent bus often have similar delays due to traffic conditions.
